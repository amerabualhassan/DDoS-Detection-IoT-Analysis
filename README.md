# DDoS Detection in IoT: Deep Learning vs Machine Learning Analysis

This repository summarizes and analyzes the research paper titled:

**"DDoS Attack Detection in IoT: A Comparative Resource and Performance Analysis of Deep Learning and Machine Learning Models"**

Published in IEEE Access, 2025.

## üìÑ Summary

The paper compares deep learning (DL) and traditional machine learning (ML) approaches for detecting Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks in Internet of Things (IoT) environments. 

### Key Highlights:
- **Dataset**: CICDDoS2019 (CSV and image formats)
- **ML Models**: Random Forest, SVM, Logistic Regression
- **DL Models**: CNN, MobileNetV3, EfficientNetB0, Xception
- **Metrics Evaluated**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, AUC, Inference Time, CPU and Memory Usage

### Conclusions:
- **Deep Learning** provides high accuracy but is slower.
- **Machine Learning** models are faster and more efficient, better for real-time IoT applications.
