# DDoS-Detection-IoT-Analysis
The paper evaluates DDoS detection in IoT using lightweight deep learning and machine learning models. Using the CICDDoS2019 dataset, it compares detection accuracy and resource efficiency. Results show ML models offer faster inference for real-time use, while DL models provide higher accuracy but with higher resource costs.
